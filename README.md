Analysis of Public Transport to aid demand and capacity planning at PTV

We read a csv for growth data from Victoria government to create a data frame with
growth by suburb/area for the years 2016 to 2036 (Growth_data_suburbs.ipynb)
The output was used to map the coordinates and produce a map (all_growth_map.png in /output). 
We then created a datafile with the largest growth area and mapped these along with 
the stations proposed by Dan Andrews in his future rail proposal (Map_with_stations.png)

Project Outline:
PTV planning  team requested  Group2's support to  establish the relationship between current public transport infrastructure and population in Victorian suburbs. 
The key questions the would like to have an answer on are:
 -  What is the current correlation between public transport availability and population.
 -  What are the top three suburbs in 2023 for public transport availability
    (additionally rule out CBD etc and look at reasons for correlation)
 -  What are the top 5 areas/suburbs that will require the highest level of development.
 - What number of stops and additional equipment will be required to reach the current “best of class” levels of the top suburbs of question 2
   If there’s going to be 50% growth in x suburb - they’re going to need \
   Population to pt stop ratio (eg, CDB has 1:1000 ratio)
   cut the data into groups

The request is to present a summary  and visualisation of the analysis on January  17 to aid PTV in future infrastructure planning.

The team will obtain data sets through APIs and other available sources to aid in answering the above questions.

A presentation of a summary of the project results will be given on January 17th to the PTV management team.
