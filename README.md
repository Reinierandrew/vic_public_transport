Analysis of Public Transport to aid demand and capacity planning at PTV

We read a csv for growth data from Victoria government to create a data frame with
growth by suburb/area for the years 2016 to 2036 (Growth_data_suburbs.ipynb)
The output was used to map the coordinates and produce a map (all_growth_map.png in /output). 
We then created a datafile with the largest growth area and mapped these along with 
the stations proposed by Dan Andrews in his future rail proposal (Map_with_stations.png)

 -  What is the current correlation between public transport availability and population.
 -  What are the top three suburbs in 2023 for public transport availability
 -  What are the top 5 areas/suburbs that will require the highest level of development.
 - What number of stops and additional equipment will be required to reach the current “best of class” levels of the top suburbs
